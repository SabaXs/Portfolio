                <h2>Parkinson's Detection Using Random Forest Classifier</h2><br>
                <p>I created a versatile model that utilizes various voice features as input and undergoes training with different classifiers. The primary objective is to analyze a consistent set of features and predict the diagnosis of a new voice. Assessing the model's performance, I calculated the AUC-ROC curve for each classifier, ultimately determining that Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy among them. This outcome underscores the effectiveness of Random Forest in accurately predicting voice diagnoses.</p>

              <h2>Detection of Conversion from MCI to AD using Open CV and DeepLearning Techniques</h2><br>
              <p>The project aims to develop a user-friendly computer vision and deep learning solution for analyzing and detecting the conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Leveraging neuroimaging data, particularly MRI scans, the system extracts features and identifies patterns that signify the progression from MCI to AD. The ultimate goal is to provide a reliable and accessible web interface for early detection and intervention in neurodegenerative conditions.</p>
